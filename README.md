# Lumina Electrics Website

This is the main marketing website for Lumina Electrics. It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for potential customers.

## Main page structure

The main page consists of a header with a logo and navbar in addition with another four sections and a footer.
   * First section contains the hero image.
   * Second section contains About Us information.
   * Third section contains tabs so that the user can easily navigate through the services provided by the company.

   * Fourth section contains the Contact us form and accreditations owed. Within this section there is a button. When the user clicks the button a pop-up window appears containing a contact form. The user can input their information to get in touch with the company. The contact form is static only, meaning clicking "Submit" does not actually send the information given anywhere.

## Deployment procedure

The first step of the procedure is to come up with a design. Once I've created the design on Balsamiq wareframes the steps taken were:

   * Incerting the logo and creating a navbar that is easy and fairly simple to use. Once clicked it takes the user to the relevat section.
   * Adding the hero image so it gives more style to the main page.
   * Creating About Us section.
   * Creating Our services section with a tab bar that clearly states the services provided.
   * Creating the contact form as a pop-up when contact us button is clicked.
   * As a last step i have created the footer that includes the social media links and the contact details of the company.

Once the webpage been fully created, I staged it to be pushed to github by using the Git version control system.
The final step used was pushing the finished product to github.

* The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
